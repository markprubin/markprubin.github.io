						<li>
							Local storage is fun to figure out. It has been interesting adding it to my F1 Analyst Dashboard app to ensure that I don't overload the API. The API is great, and I don't want to cause any issues with it.
						</li>
						<li>
							I have been focusing on array and object extraction, especially with destructuring them to extract the data necessary. I have a potential 2nd round interview coming up, and with loads of data through the app and working with sports teams, this is necessary for streamlined data visualization.
						</li>
					</ul>
				<h4 class="major">Reflection</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							I need to find a more consistent schedule with keeping up to date on my DS&A learnings. I finally subscribed to a Leetcode subscription, and that even though it does cost money, the goal is to get a job. So it will pay off in the long run. I also got an Udemy course for specific guided DS&A work with Javascript.
						</li>
						<li>
							I need to work on my verbalization of live technical coding interviews, and patiently work out my process on problem solving. I need to tell myself that even though I may not solve a problem, the process of asking questions, clarifying what the interviewer is asking, and working my way through it is just as important. Communication is key!

							In preparation for a potential job interview, I am diving into Typescript. It has been interesting learning the differences between the more rigid nature of Typescript and how it can make things a bit more smooth and also check for any errors in a massive project.
						</li>
						<li>
							My F1 dashboard on react has been pretty fun building. I have realized that there may be a potential of overloading calls on the API, and to prevent that, I have had to look into caching my data and using local storage to do so.

						<li>Unfortunately, I did not get the job. I got through to the 3rd round, but that was the technical interview. My first one ever. And I made silly mistakes. I know now to get some mock interviews out of the way to handle the pressure.
						</li>
						<li>
							I learned how to deploy an app! At least the backend so far. I have been using Render to do so. It is my "The Life Walk-On Social" app that has a separate back end and front end. The front end I plan on using Netlify. But it is pretty cool seeing something off my local storage and actually deployed! I'll have to go into the front end and change all my API calls from local host to the new URL.

							I need to structure my days better. It would help either picking certain days to do DS&A and others to work on projects, or finding a time in the day to do DS&A and the latter part of the day for projects. Either way, it will help with the anxiety I feel for not doing "enough."
						</li>
						<li>
							Job applications are restarting for me. I need to stay diligent, reach out to recruiters more often, and ask them specific questions regarding hiring. I am doing great with networking, but that is a slow cooker approach. I have no problem talking with people. It is a strength of mine. I just don't see much success with randomly applying to jobs. So following up with positions can help!

				<ul>
					<li>Another hiatus. Easier said than done. Lot has happened over the last few months personally, which is a reason for my absence.
					</li>
					<li>Just finished a 3rd round interview for a software consulting company. It was my first technical interview, and it didn't go as smooth as I hoped. Very basic things that are very routine became silly errors, but I am hoping that these little things don't count against me. I definitely got into my own head in certain instances, and was overthinking some aspects of the two questions I got. Once I got to the 2nd question, I only had about 7-8 minutes. I wrote half the code, and instead of letting frustration get to me and just giving up, I talked my way through the rest for the sake of time. She understood that I knew it, but I am still hoping they see that I am willing to grow and learn.</li>
					<li>I really trust my soft skills and ability to work on a team, communicate effectively, and communicate with future clients. Crossing my fingers!
					</li>
				</ul>
					<h4 class="major">Reflection</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							I need to do a better job of organizaing my schedule a bit more. I tend to go all in on either a project, or working on DS&A. I need to be diligent with setting aside a few hours for my projects, taking breaks, and then setting aside time for problem solving and algorithims. I need more control, instead of letting external things dictate my learning.
						</li>
						<li>
							I need to also update my work journal consistently. I have decided to change the date to the beginning of the week, so I can update it as I go, instead of at the end. Reflecting at the end of the week is great. But I do want to use it to write things down as I go, like a journal is supposed to be used for. So from here on out, the date will be the Monday of each week.
						</li>

								<p> I thought this was interesting. I think it will definitely help with efficiency and speed, especially with future coding interviews.</p>

								<a href="https://ui.dev/why-react-renders">The Interactive Guide to Rendering in React</a>
								<p>Since I have been doing a lot of React lately, I came across this from a Reddit post that someone shared. Seems like a great resource that not only breaks react down fairly well, but let's you see real time how code works.</p>
