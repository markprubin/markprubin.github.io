			<h3 class="major">Learnings and Experiences</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Another hiatus. Easier said than done. Lot has happened over the last few months personally, which is a reason for my absence.
					</li>
					<li>Just finished a 3rd round interview for a software consulting company. It was my first technical interview, and it didn't go as smooth as I hoped. Very basic things that are very routine became silly errors, but I am hoping that these little things don't count against me. I definitely got into my own head in certain instances, and was overthinking some aspects of the two questions I got. Once I got to the 2nd question, I only had about 7-8 minutes. I wrote half the code, and instead of letting frustration get to me and just giving up, I talked my way through the rest for the sake of time. She understood that I knew it, but I am still hoping they see that I am willing to grow and learn.</li>
					<li>I really trust my soft skills and ability to work on a team, communicate effectively, and communicate with future clients. Crossing my fingers!
					</li>
				</ul>
					<h3 class="major">Reflection</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							I need to do a better job of organizaing my schedule a bit more. I tend to go all in on either a project, or working on DS&A. I need to be diligent with setting aside a few hours for my projects, taking breaks, and then setting aside time for problem solving and algorithims. I need more control, instead of letting external things dictate my learning.
						</li>
						<li>
							I need to also update my work journal consistently. I have decided to change the date to the beginning of the week, so I can update it as I go, instead of at the end. Reflecting at the end of the week is great. But I do want to use it to write things down as I go, like a journal is supposed to be used for. So from here on out, the date will be the Monday of each week.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="major">Interesting Things</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<a href="www.speedcoder.net">Speedcoder.net</a>
								<p> I thought this was interesting. I think it will definitely help with efficiency and speed, especially with future coding interviews.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://ui.dev/why-react-renders">The Interactive Guide to Rendering in React</a>
								<p>Since I have been doing a lot of React lately, I came across this from a Reddit post that someone shared. Seems like a great resource that not only breaks react down fairly well, but let's you see real time how code works.</p>
